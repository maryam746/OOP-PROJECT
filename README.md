# OOP-PROJECT

A Rubik's Cube Solver built with C++ and OpenGL, featuring real-time 3D rendering, interactive cube manipulation, and an automated solving algorithm.

3D Cube Rendering – OpenGL-based visualization of the Rubik’s Cube//
User Interaction – Rotate cube faces with keyboard/mouse input//
Smooth Animations – Step-by-step solution visualization
Customizable Cube – Modify colors, textures, or cube size
Custom Scramble Generator – Generates random solvable states


Technologies used:
C++ – Core programming language
OpenGL (GLFW/GLUT) – Graphics rendering
